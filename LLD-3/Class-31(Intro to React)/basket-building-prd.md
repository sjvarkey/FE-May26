## Problem Alignment

### **The Problem**

E-commerce platforms face a critical profitability challenge: **69.99% cart abandonment rate** and low average order values, particularly for low-priced goods. Current basket building adoption sits at only **4%** of the user base, resulting in missed revenue opportunities and inefficient supply chain utilization.

**Key Business Impact:**
- Fixed supply chain costs remain high for single-item orders
- Low Average Order Value (AOV) impacts profitability
- High cart abandonment leads to lost revenue
- Inefficient packaging and shipping costs
- Competitive disadvantage in unit economics

**Business Value Estimate:** Increasing basket building from 4% to 10% could generate **‚Çπ176,310 crores** in additional annual revenue across major Indian e-commerce platforms.

### **High-level Approach**

Implement a three-pronged strategy focusing on:
1. **Visibility** - Make basket building advantages clear through discount incentives
2. **Cross-selling** - Intelligent product recommendations across categories
3. **Delivery Optimization** - Flexible delivery options to encourage consolidated orders

### **Goals & Success**

**North Star Metric:** Increase basket building adoption from 4% to 10% of user base

**Key Metrics:**
- Average Order Value (AOV) increase by 25%
- Cart abandonment rate reduction from 70% to 60%
- Cross-sell conversion rate of 15%

**A/B Testing Plan:**
- Test discount thresholds (‚Çπ500 vs ‚Çπ750 vs ‚Çπ1000 minimum order value)
- Compare recommendation algorithms (collaborative vs content-based)
- Evaluate delivery messaging effectiveness
